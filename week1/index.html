    Instructors: Dr. Rohit Ashok Khot, Patrick McMahon Group 1: Every Wednesday
    (04:30 pm - 07:30 pm) Our focus will be on building up from the basic
    principles of programming, covering the standard web languages - HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript, in order to be able to select and use appropriate
    programming languages, together with core concepts of interaction design, in
    service of your broader digital design goals. Course-Specific Learning
    Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, you will have a comprehensive
    understanding of the key concepts of interactivity, user experience design,
    and information architecture in web-based environments. You will also be
    able to identify and utilize the appropriate technologies to address
    interactive design challenges. Furthermore, you will have the skills to
    analyze user needs, organize information, and create effective navigation
    strategies. Additionally, you will be proficient in controlling the visual
    aspects of typography, color, and layouts through scripting languages and
    coding, ensuring compatibility across multiple platforms. Lastly, you will
    be able to critically evaluate web projects based on user-centered design
    principles.
